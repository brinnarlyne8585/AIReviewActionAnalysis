https://api.github.com/repos/parkpow/deep-license-plate-recognition/pulls/comments/1929972018,2,"1. enhance the error log to include additional context (e.g. the request url or payload). for example:

https://api.github.com/repos/saiqulhaq/dynamic_links/pulls/comments/1438979305,2,"1. after the test “generate_short_url returns the correct structure”, add an `ensure` block to reset the configuration and prevent side effects in other tests:

https://api.github.com/repos/saiqulhaq/dynamic_links/pulls/comments/1743909207,2,"1. the check for `link.expires_at.present?` is redundant because `link.expires_at.past?` will return false if `expires_at` is `nil`. simplify the line by removing the `present?` check:
