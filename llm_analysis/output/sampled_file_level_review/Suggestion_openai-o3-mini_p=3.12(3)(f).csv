2. in the showringtonepicker function, the reviewer recommends replacing the generic exception catch block with more specific exception catches.
3. in the userfriendlytitle function, the reviewer advises handling exceptions more specifically (e.g., catching nosuchelementexception or securityexception individually) rather than using runcatching.
4. in the private extension function for ringtone, the reviewer questions the motivation for renaming the gettitle method to title, suggesting that this renaming might lead to confusion."

2. ""backward compatibility: when adding a new field to a protocol buffers message schema, make sure that the changes do not break older clients or servers that might still be expecting the previous format. if this is a concern, consider how versioning or backward-compatible approaches can be implemented."""
https://api.github.com/repos/pokt-network/pocket/pulls/comments/1180843923,2,"1. error handling in the init() function: instead of logging an error and assigning ""default"" to the namespace when getnamespace() fails, propagate the error upward so that users of the package get notified of the issue.
2. use context properly: accept a context.context as an argument in the fetchvalidatorprivatekeys function (instead of using context.todo()) and pass that context to the kubernetes client's get call. this change would allow the caller to cancel or manage request behavior as needed."
