## **Annotation Guidelines: Assessing Whether Review Comments Are Addressed**

This task aims to determine **whether a review comment has been addressed** by the **subsequent code changes**.
 The task is divided into two subtasks:

------

### **Subtask 1: Determine Whether the Comment Contains Specific Issues or Suggestions**

Identify the issues or suggestions raised in the review comment. Then, assess whether each of them is **valid** or not.

- **Valid** issue or suggestion must be:

  - **Directly related** to the reviewed code file;
  - **Actionable**: Can only be resolved/responded to by modifying the code;
  - **Specific:** Clearly pointing out the issues to be resolved or providing concrete suggestions to be followed;
- The following are considered only **general** issues or suggestions, but **NOT valid**:

  - **Overly generic suggestions** that could apply to any code (e.g., `"it's generally a good practice to keep dependencies up-to-date, use secure versions, and remove unused dependencies to reduce package size and potential security risks"`)
  - **Comments that cannot be reflected in code changes** (e.g., `"Ensure something is right."`)

- The following are **NOT** considered issues or suggestions at all:
  - Praise  (e.g., `"Good Change!"`);
  - Comments that have been implemented (e.g., some developers like to explain why they made the change in their review comments);
  - Suggestions unrelated to the reviewed file (e.g. requests more context for a better review);

#### **Classification Scale:**

- `0`: **Not Contain Any Items** – The comment contains no issues or suggestions.
- `1`: **Only Contain General Items** – The comment contains only general issues or suggestions.
- `2`: **Contain Specific Items** – The comment contains at least one valid issues or suggestions.

------

### **Subtask 2: Determine Whether the Specific Items Have Been Addressed**

For review comments classified as `2` in Subtask 1 (i.e., containing specific items), determine whether the identified **issues or suggestions have been addressed** in the **subsequent code changes**.

An item is considered **addressed** if:

- The specific **problem was fixed**.
- The **suggestion was followed**.
- If the suggestion includes concrete code examples, it does **not** need to be followed exactly.
   As long as the code change serves the **same intended purpose**, the suggestion can be considered addressed.
- (An issue/suggestion can only be in one of two states: addressed or not addressed.)

#### **Classification Scale:**

- `-1`: **Not Enough Information** – Cannot determine whether the issues or suggestions were addressed.
- `0`: **Not Addressed** – None of the issues or suggestions were addressed.
- `1`: **Partly Addressed** – Some, but not all, issues or suggestions were addressed.
- `2`: **Fully Addressed** – All issues or suggestions were addressed.
