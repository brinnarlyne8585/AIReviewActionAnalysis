https://api.github.com/repos/pass-culture/data-gcp/pulls/comments/1880340949,2,- there is a typo in the variable name `deploy_model_taks` (should be `deploy_model_tasks` based on the context of task-related naming).
https://api.github.com/repos/pokt-network/pocket/pulls/comments/1210858477,2,"- the reviewer suggests assigning directly to `payload.jsonrpcpayload.headers[header.name]` instead of creating a new `headers` map, implying that `payload.jsonrpcpayload.headers` may already be initialized as an empty map. this targets the lines initializing `headers := make(map[string]string)` and the loop assigning values to `headers[header.name]`."

https://api.github.com/repos/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/aeon_mecha/pulls/comments/1820658854,2,"- the comment ""s101: replaced assertions with exceptions"" suggests that the removed assertions (`assert len(exp_subjects) == test_params[""subject_count""]` and `assert ""baa-1100701"" in exp_subjects`) should be replaced with explicit exception handling (e.g., raising `valueerror` or similar) instead of relying on `assert`, which is actionable and specific to the reviewed code changes. the current code change only adds an `if` condition but does not implement proper exception handling, indicating the suggestion is valid and requires modification to the file."

https://api.github.com/repos/pokt-network/pocket/pulls/comments/1228792764,2,"- the review comment suggests replacing the hardcoded `address` and `publickey` values with dynamically generated ones using the utilities `crypto.generatepublickey()` and `crypto.generateaddress()` to ensure compatibility. this directly targets the lines:

https://api.github.com/repos/pokt-network/pocket/pulls/comments/1205997356,2,"- the review comment suggests leveraging an existing helper function in `shared/crypto/sha3.go` instead of implementing a new `hash` function, which implies replacing or modifying the added `func hash(data []byte) ([]byte, error) {` code."
https://api.github.com/repos/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/aeon_mecha/pulls/comments/1829515344,2,"- remove the added `""up017""` from the linter configuration since the project uses python >= 3.11 and can directly use `datetime.utc` without skipping the check."

https://api.github.com/repos/pokt-network/pocket/pulls/comments/1209947205,2,"- the review suggests that instead of the current approach in `getindexedtransaction`, the `txindexer` could be used exclusively for this functionality since it now operates on the same hash for both proto and indexed transactions. this implies a potential code modification to rely on `txindexer` rather than re-implementing similar logic."
https://api.github.com/repos/pass-culture/data-gcp/pulls/comments/1863764089,2,"- the term ""structures"" should be replaced with ""cultural entities"" in the added line: `structures which have no permanent venue` → `cultural entities which have no permanent venue`."
