- The suggestion to ""drop the `return` statements in the fixtures that do not return anything"" specifically applies to the added `return` statement in the Reviewed Change (`+    return`). Since the fixture code includes a `return` but appears to return nothing (no value after `return`), this is an actionable request to remove an unnecessary line.

","Issues or Suggestions:
- The review suggests replacing hardcoded `Address` and `PublicKey` values with dynamically generated ones using the provided utilities (`crypto.GeneratePublicKey()` and `crypto.GenerateAddress()`) to ensure compatibility. The code snippet explicitly shows how to implement this, indicating the specific parts of the Reviewed Change (the hardcoded values) should be modified.

","Issues or Suggestions:
- The comment suggests considering replacing the current approach (using the hash of proto bytes and hydrate function) with the `TxIndexer` for the `GetIndexedTransaction` function, since the `TxIndexer` now uses the same hash for both proto and indexed transactions.
