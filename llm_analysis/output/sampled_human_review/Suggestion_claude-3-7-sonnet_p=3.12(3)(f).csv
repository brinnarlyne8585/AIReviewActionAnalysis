https://api.github.com/repos/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/aeon_mecha/pulls/comments/1826216808,2,"1. the docstring formatting needs to be corrected. bullet lists need to start after a linebreak, and when breaking bullet descriptions into multiple lines, they need to align with the first line for proper rendering. the reviewer provides a complete reformatted docstring that fixes these issues and removes the need for noqa 501.

2. the reviewer suggests keeping line 4 which was removed in the change: ""4. shift back the pellet delivery timestamps by 1 to match the pellet delivery with the previous threshold update"""

https://api.github.com/repos/pokt-network/pocket/pulls/comments/1220406444,2,optional nit: i feel like single lining this whole statement (even if it's > 80 chars) will make it easier to read

https://api.github.com/repos/pokt-network/pocket/pulls/comments/1184416497,2,"the reviewer suggests restructuring the code to improve readability by inverting the condition and handling the special case first:

https://api.github.com/repos/pokt-network/pocket/pulls/comments/1206007090,2,"1. consider decoupling ""getsession"" and ""getservicer"" or getting the session in place and passing that to `fetchservicer`

https://api.github.com/repos/pokt-network/pocket/pulls/comments/1210858477,2,- why not assign to `payload.jsonrpcpayload.headers[header.name]` directly? i believe it's auto initialized to an empty map.
