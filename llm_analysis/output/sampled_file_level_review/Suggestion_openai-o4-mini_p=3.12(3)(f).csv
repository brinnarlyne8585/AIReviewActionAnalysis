2. instead of using a generic `catch (e: exception)` block in `showringtonepicker`, catch more specific exceptions that can occur when starting activities or dealing with intents.
3. in the `userfriendlytitle` function, replace the single `runcatching` block with individual exception handlers (e.g., `nosuchelementexception`, `securityexception`) and provide appropriate fallback behavior or error messages."

2. use context properly: accept a `context.context` as an argument to the `fetchvalidatorprivatekeys` function (rather than using `context.todo()`) and pass that context into `clientset.corev1().secrets(...).get(...)` to allow proper cancellation or other contextual behavior."

https://api.github.com/repos/Kanaries/graphic-walker/issues/comments/1891515273,2,"1. avoid using magic strings: there are several instances where string literals are used to represent types (e.g., `'field'`, `'expression'`, `'sql'`, `'map'`, `'newmap'`). these could be replaced with a typescript enum or a set of string literal types to avoid potential typos and make the code easier to understand.
2. avoid using `any` type: in the `toworkflow` function, `f.aggname as any` is used. using `any` defeats the purpose of typescript's type checking and can lead to runtime errors. it would be better to define a more specific type for `aggname`.
3. avoid using non-null assertion operator (!): non-null assertions (e.g., `f.rule!`) can lead to runtime errors if the value is actually `null` or `undefined`. it would be safer to add proper null checks or use optional chaining (`?.`).
4. avoid using `console.error` for error handling: in the `createfilter` function, `console.error` is used when an unknown rule type is encountered. it would be better to throw an error or handle this case more gracefully."
