   - this suggestion is specific and actionable, as it directs the developer to add a tech debt comment in the reviewed file explaining that the current structures are placeholders copied from v0 and require updating for v1, with a reference link for further details."
https://api.github.com/repos/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/aeon_mecha/pulls/comments/1829250184,2,"1. the reviewer specifically suggests changing the code snippet:

     +                    stacklevel=2,
   • to:
     +                    f""data index for {reader.pattern} contains out-of-order timestamps!"", stacklevel=2
   this suggestion is valid because it clearly identifies the exact code lines to be modified in the reviewed file.
2. the reviewer also writes “revert black”. although brief, it appears to be a request to undo the black‐induced formatting changes in the reviewed file. however, it is less specific than the code snippet change."
https://api.github.com/repos/pokt-network/pocket/pulls/comments/1228789399,2,"1. ""can't we just get it directly from `session`?"" – suggest modifying the approach in the function to retrieve the current height directly from the passed session.
2. ""if not, we should be able to do `s.getbus().getconsensusmodule().currentheight()`"" – proposes an alternative method by using the service bus's consensus module to fetch the current height.
3. ""if neither 1 or 2 work, this is `techdebt`, not `improve` imo"" – recommends updating the comment from ""improve"" to ""techdebt"" if the above alternatives are not suitable."
