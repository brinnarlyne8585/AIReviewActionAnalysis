https://api.github.com/repos/pokt-network/pocket/pulls/comments/1228792764,2,"1. the hardcoded actor address and public key should be replaced with dynamically generated keys using the project's crypto utilities to ensure compatibility and consistency.

specifically, the suggestion recommends replacing the hardcoded values:
- `""a3d9ea9d9ad9c58bb96ec41340f83cb2cabb6496""` should be replaced with `outputaddr`
