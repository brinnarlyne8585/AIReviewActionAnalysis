- Reviewed Path: The file path of the code change.
- Reviewed Change: The code change under review. (""+"" indicates added lines, ""-"" indicates removed lines)
- Review Comment: A list of issues or suggestions for the above changes.
Subsequent Code Changes: A cumulative code changes made to the reviewed file after the review.

Task: For each item in the Review Comment, analyze whether it has been addressed by the Subsequent Code Changes by determining if:
- The issue has been completely resolved.
- The suggestion has been completely followed. (If the suggestion includes concrete code examples, it does not need to be followed exactly. As long as the code change serves the same intended purpose, the suggestion can be considered addressed.)
After completing the analysis, classify the entire review comment into one of the following categories:
- Not Addressed: None of the issues or suggestions have been addressed by the Subsequent Code Changes.
- Partly Addressed: Some but not all issues or suggestions have been addressed.
- Fully Addressed: All issues or suggestions have been addressed.
If the code relevant to the Review Comment has been completely removed in the Subsequent Code Changes, and it is not possible to determine whether the removal was an intentional response to the comment, you can classify it as ""Not Enough Information"".

- Addressed Items:
  • The changes adding .toUri() calls when setting extras in showRingtonePicker and when retrieving the ringtone in userFriendlyTitle show minor handling improvements related to URI conversion.
- Unaddressed Items:

  • Adding more targeted error handling around the call to startActivityForResult.
  • Catching specific exceptions rather than a generic Exception in showRingtonePicker.
  • Handling potential null values returned by getParcelableExtra in getPickedRingtone.
  • Replacing the generic runCatching block with handling of specific exceptions in userFriendlyTitle.
  • Clarifying the renaming of the original getTitle method to title in the private extension function for Ringtone.

Output: List the addressed and unaddressed items, and make the final classification.
","Analysis details:
- Addressed Items: 
  • Consistency in naming: The enum constant was renamed from NOT_COMPLETE_AUCTION to NOT_COMPLETED_AUCTION.
- Unaddressed Items: 
  • Typographical error: The typo “겅매” in the message for the auction constant remains unchanged.
  • Semicolon placement: There was no change in placing the semicolon on a new line.
  • Documentation: No comments or Javadoc were added for the enum constants.

Classification: Partly Addressed"
https://api.github.com/repos/UnUniFi/chain/pulls/comments/1189776413,"Input Format:
Code Review:
- Reviewed Path: The file path of the code change.
- Reviewed Change: The code change under review. (""+"" indicates added lines, ""-"" indicates removed lines)
- Review Comment: A list of issues or suggestions for the above changes.
Subsequent Code Changes: A cumulative code changes made to the reviewed file after the review.

Task: For each item in the Review Comment, analyze whether it has been addressed by the Subsequent Code Changes by determining if:
- The issue has been completely resolved.
- The suggestion has been completely followed. (If the suggestion includes concrete code examples, it does not need to be followed exactly. As long as the code change serves the same intended purpose, the suggestion can be considered addressed.)
After completing the analysis, classify the entire review comment into one of the following categories:
- Not Addressed: None of the issues or suggestions have been addressed by the Subsequent Code Changes.
- Partly Addressed: Some but not all issues or suggestions have been addressed.
- Fully Addressed: All issues or suggestions have been addressed.
If the code relevant to the Review Comment has been completely removed in the Subsequent Code Changes, and it is not possible to determine whether the removal was an intentional response to the comment, you can classify it as ""Not Enough Information"".

Output Format:
Analysis details:
- Addressed Items: List the issues or suggestions that have been addressed.
- Unaddressed Items: List the issues or suggestions that have not been addressed.
Classification: Based on the Addressed Items and Unaddressed Items, select one of ""Not Addressed"", ""Partly Addressed"", ""Fully Addressed"", or ""Not Enough Information"" as the final classification without more explanations.

","Analysis details:
- Addressed Items:
  1. Consistent formatting – The helper method (createBinding) refactors the binding logic, resulting in more consistent and cleaner formatting.
  2. Method naming consistency – The method previously named productCancelBinding has been renamed to productFlagBinding to match the queue name.
  3. Reduce redundancy – A createBinding helper method has been introduced to eliminate repetitive code across binding definitions.
- Unaddressed Items:
  4. Documentation – No comments or Javadoc have been added to explain the purpose of each binding.

","Analysis details:
- Addressed Items: The review comment’s concern about duplicate faucet endpoints has been addressed. In the subsequent code changes, the previously active faucet entries using faucetUguuPort (for both 'uguu' and 'uusdc') have been removed (commented out), and a new faucet entry now uses a distinct variable (faucetStakePort) for the ‘stake’ denomination. This indicates that the duplicate, likely copy–pasted entries (including those for faucetJpuPort and faucetUethPort) have been reviewed and removed from active configuration.

Code Review:
- Reviewed Path: The file path of the code change.
- Reviewed Change: The code change under review. (""+"" indicates added lines, ""-"" indicates removed lines)
- Review Comment: A list of issues or suggestions for the above changes.
Subsequent Code Changes: A cumulative code changes made to the reviewed file after the review.

Task: For each item in the Review Comment, analyze whether it has been addressed by the Subsequent Code Changes by determining if:
- The issue has been completely resolved.
- The suggestion has been completely followed. (If the suggestion includes concrete code examples, it does not need to be followed exactly. As long as the code change serves the same intended purpose, the suggestion can be considered addressed.)
After completing the analysis, classify the entire review comment into one of the following categories:
- Not Addressed: None of the issues or suggestions have been addressed by the Subsequent Code Changes.
- Partly Addressed: Some but not all issues or suggestions have been addressed.
- Fully Addressed: All issues or suggestions have been addressed.
If the code relevant to the Review Comment has been completely removed in the Subsequent Code Changes, and it is not possible to determine whether the removal was an intentional response to the comment, you can classify it as ""Not Enough Information"".
