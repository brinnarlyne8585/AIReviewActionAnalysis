The old attributes `redis_config`, `redis_pool_size`, and `redis_pool_timeout` have been removed, and new ones like `shortening_strategy`, `enable_rest_api`, `db_infra_strategy`, `async_processing`, `redis_counter_config`, and `cache_store_config` have been added. This change seems to be in line with the PR's goal of introducing asynchronous URL shortening and supporting different cache stores (Redis and Memcached).

However, there is a potential issue with the `shorten_url` method. It assumes that the strategy class exists and can be initialized without arguments. If the configuration contains an invalid strategy name, this will raise a `NameError`. Also, if the strategy class requires initialization parameters, it will raise an `ArgumentError`. To improve error handling, consider adding a rescue block to handle these exceptions and provide a more user-friendly error message.\n\n```diff\n  def self.shorten_url(url)\n    begin\n      strategy_class = \""DynamicLinks::ShorteningStrategies::#{configuration.shortening_strategy.to_s.camelize}Strategy\"".constantize\n      strategy = strategy_class.new\n    rescue NameError\n      raise \""Invalid shortening strategy: #{configuration.shortening_strategy}\""\n    rescue ArgumentError\n      raise \""#{strategy_class} needs to be initialized with arguments\""\n    end\n    strategy.shorten(url)\n  end\n```\n\nThis way, if an invalid strategy is configured or if the strategy class requires initialization parameters, a clear error message will be raised, making it easier for developers to debug the issue.\n\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment by OSS CodeRabbit -->""

It's a good practice to extract this kind of logic into a separate method to avoid code duplication. However, the method is quite complex and might be hard to understand and maintain. Consider breaking it down into smaller methods, each responsible for a specific part of the process (e.g., configuring the system, preparing the mocks, running the operation, asserting the results). Also, consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each step, especially for complex operations like the ones involving mocks and stubs.\n\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment by OSS CodeRabbit -->""

You're sorting the salary list twice: once for `sortedData` and once for `latestSalaryList`. If the salary list is large, this could be inefficient.
