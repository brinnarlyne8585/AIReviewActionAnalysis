https://api.github.com/repos/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/aeon_mecha/pulls/comments/1777229984,2,"- the current implementation of `class_int2str` method has a complexity of o(n^2) because for each class, it iterates over the entire dataframe to replace the integer identity with the string identity. this could be optimized by creating a mapping dictionary and using the pandas `replace` function, which would reduce the complexity to o(n). specific code modification suggested via:
```diff
-        identity = data[""identity""].astype(""string"")
-        for i, subj in enumerate(classes):
-            identity.loc[data[identity.name] == i] = subj

https://api.github.com/repos/saiqulhaq/dynamic_links/pulls/comments/1443729766,2,"- the `perform` method does not handle exceptions during `shortenedurl.find_or_create(client, short_url, url)` or `dynamiclinks.configuration.cache_store.delete(lock_key)`, which could lead to unhandled job failures. the suggestion is to wrap these operations in a `begin-rescue` block to log errors and optionally re-raise exceptions, with a specific code example provided:
```ruby
    def perform(client, url, short_url, lock_key)
      begin
      shortenedurl.find_or_create(client, short_url, url)

https://api.github.com/repos/saiqulhaq/dynamic_links/pulls/comments/1743909207,2,- the check for `link.expires_at.present?` is redundant because `link.expires_at.past?` will return false if `expires_at` is `nil`. you can simplify this line by removing the `present?` check and using `link.expires_at&.past?`.
https://api.github.com/repos/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/aeon_mecha/pulls/comments/1765246060,2,- the command for running all tests (`# pytest -sv --cov-report term-missing --cov=aeon_mecha -p no:warnings tests/dj_pipeline`) is commented out and could be included in the docstring for clarity.
https://api.github.com/repos/saiqulhaq/dynamic_links/pulls/comments/1438979300,2,"- the `shorten_url` method assumes the strategy class exists and can be initialized without arguments. if the configuration contains an invalid strategy name, this will raise a `nameerror`. if the strategy class requires initialization parameters, it will raise an `argumenterror`. suggested adding error handling with a rescue block to raise user-friendly messages:  
```diff
