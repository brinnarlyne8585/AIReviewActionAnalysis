https://api.github.com/repos/Kanaries/graphic-walker/issues/comments/1891515273,2,"1. **avoid using magic strings**: replace string literals (e.g., `'map'`, `'newmap'`) with a typescript enum or string literal types. example suggestion includes defining `enum paramtype` and using `paramtype.map` instead of `'map'` in code like `type: 'map' as const`."

https://api.github.com/repos/fresh-trash-project/fresh-trash-backend/pulls/comments/1639543878,2,"1. **consistent formatting**: ensure consistent formatting throughout the code. for example, align method chaining for better readability (e.g., align `productcancelbinding` to use multi-line chaining like other methods).
2. **method naming consistency**: rename `productcancelbinding` to `productflagbinding` to match the queue name (`productflagqueue`).
3. **reduce redundancy**: create a helper method (e.g., `createbinding`) to handle repetitive binding creation logic across multiple methods.
4. **documentation**: add comments or javadoc to explain the purpose of each binding."

3. consider modifying the `types` field of the `pull_request` event to only trigger the workflow on certain kinds of events.

https://api.github.com/repos/fresh-trash-project/fresh-trash-backend/pulls/comments/1639543374,2,"1. **exception handling**: instead of catching `throwable`, catch specific exceptions to avoid handling errors that you might not want to handle (like `outofmemoryerror`).  
   (implemented as changing `catch (throwable e)` to `catch (exception e)` in `sendack` method.)

2. **logging**: improve the log messages for clarity and consistency.  
   (example changes: `""occurs error during publish message.""` → `""error occurred during message publishing.""`, and adjusting log messages in `channelsend` for ack/reject actions.)

3. **return value**: ensure that the return value is handled correctly when an exception occurs.  
   (original code returns `null` after catching an exception; revised code re-throws the exception with `throw e;` to propagate the error.)

4. **code structure**: separate concerns by keeping the acknowledgment logic (including logging) in the `channelsend` method.

https://api.github.com/repos/fresh-trash-project/fresh-trash-backend/pulls/comments/1641207396,2,"1. **logging context**: added `auctionid` to the log message in `closeauction` for better traceability. the original log message `log.debug(""경매 판매 상태를 close로 변경"")` lacks context like `auctionid`. the suggestion modifies it to `log.debug(""changing auction status to close for auctionid: {}"", auctionid)`.
2. **error handling**: wrapped the repository call in `closeauction` with a try-catch block to log and handle potential exceptions. the original code `auctionrepository.updateclosebyid(auctionid);` lacks error handling. the suggestion adds:
   ```java
   try {
       auctionrepository.updateclosebyid(auctionid);

       log.error(""failed to close auction with auctionid: {}"", auctionid, e);

3. **documentation**: added javadoc comments to the new methods `closeauction` and `getendedauctions` to explain their purpose and parameters. the original code lacks documentation for these methods. the suggestion adds:
   ```java
   /**
    * closes the auction by updating its status to close.
    * @param auctionid the id of the auction to close.
