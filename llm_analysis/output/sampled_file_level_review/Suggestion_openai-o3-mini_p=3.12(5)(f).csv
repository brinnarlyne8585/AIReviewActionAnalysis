https://api.github.com/repos/yuriykulikov/AlarmClock/pulls/comments/1264388529,2,"• in the showringtonepicker function, add comments explaining the purpose of each line—especially the intent extras—to improve code readability and understanding.
• instead of using a generic exception catch block in showringtonepicker, catch more specific exceptions that can occur when starting activities or dealing with intents.
• in the userfriendlytitle function, replace the generic runcatching with handling exceptions individually (e.g., nosuchelementexception, securityexception) and provide appropriate fallback behavior or error messages.
• reconsider the renaming of the gettitle method to title in the private extension function of ringtone, as this may cause confusion if the original method is part of the ringtone class."

- backward compatibility: ""when adding a new field to a protocol buffers message schema, make sure that the changes do not break older clients or servers that might still be expecting the previous format. if this is a concern, consider how versioning or backward-compatible approaches can be implemented."""

2. avoid using the any type: in the toworkflow function, change usage of “f.aggname as any” by defining a more specific type for aggname.
3. avoid using the non-null assertion operator (!): instead of using “f.rule!” rely on proper null checks or optional chaining to prevent potential runtime errors.
