2. ""instead of using a generic `exception` catch block in `showringtonepicker`, consider catching more specific exceptions that can occur when starting activities or dealing with intents.""
3. ""the `userfriendlytitle` function could benefit from more specific error handling. instead of using `runcatching`, it would be better to handle exceptions individually (e.g., `nosuchelementexception`, `securityexception`) and provide appropriate fallback behavior or error messages.""
4. ""it's unclear what the motivation is for renaming the `gettitle` method to `title` in the private extension function of `ringtone`. if the original method is part of the ringtone class, modifying its name could lead to confusion."""

2. ""use context properly: the code uses `context.todo()` while fetching secrets. it's better to accept a `context.context` as an argument to the `fetchvalidatorprivatekeys` function and pass that to the kubernetes client instead of using `context.todo()`."""

https://api.github.com/repos/Kanaries/graphic-walker/issues/comments/1891515273,2,"1. **avoid using magic strings**: there are several instances where string literals are used to represent types (e.g., 'field', 'expression', 'sql', 'map', 'newmap'). these could be replaced with a typescript enum or a set of string literal types to avoid potential typos and make the code easier to understand. example code from the reviewed change: `type: 'map' as const` and `type: 'newmap'`."

2. **method naming consistency**: rename `productcancelbinding` to `productflagbinding` to match the queue name (`productflagqueue`).  
3. **reduce redundancy**: create a helper method `createbinding` to handle repetitive binding logic (e.g., `bindingbuilder.bind(queue).to(exchange).with(routingkey)`).

2. extract the role update logic into a separate method for clarity. the line `if (flagcount >= flag_limit) this.memberservice.updatememberrole(targetmemberid, userrole.black_user);` in the `update` method should be moved to a new method `checkandupdateuserrole` as shown in the suggested code."
