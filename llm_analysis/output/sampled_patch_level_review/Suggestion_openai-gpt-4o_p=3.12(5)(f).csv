https://api.github.com/repos/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/aeon_mecha/pulls/comments/1777229984,2,"the current implementation of `class_int2str` method has a complexity of o(n^2) because for each class, it iterates over the entire dataframe to replace the integer identity with the string identity. this could be optimized by creating a mapping dictionary and using the pandas `replace` function, which would reduce the complexity to o(n).

```diff
-        identity = data[""identity""].astype(""string"")

https://api.github.com/repos/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/aeon_mecha/pulls/comments/1322223359,2,"- in the `get_bodyparts` method, the error handling for keyerror could be improved. currently, if a keyerror is raised, it checks if `parts` is none and then raises another keyerror. however, since `parts` is initialized as an empty list, it will never be none, so the error message will never be raised. instead, you should check if `parts` is empty.
  ```diff
  -         if parts is none:
