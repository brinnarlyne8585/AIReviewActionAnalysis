Code Review:
- Reviewed Path: The file path of the code change.
- Reviewed Change: The code change under review. (""+"" indicates added lines, ""-"" indicates removed lines)
- Review Comment: A list of issues or suggestions for the above changes.
Subsequent Code Changes: A cumulative code changes made to the reviewed file after the review.

Task: For each item in the Review Comment, analyze whether it has been addressed by the Subsequent Code Changes by determining if:
- The issue has been completely resolved.
- The suggestion has been completely followed. (If the suggestion includes concrete code examples, it does not need to be followed exactly. As long as the code change serves the same intended purpose, the suggestion can be considered addressed.)
After completing the analysis, classify the entire review comment into one of the following categories:
- Not Addressed: None of the issues or suggestions have been addressed by the Subsequent Code Changes.
- Partly Addressed: Some but not all issues or suggestions have been addressed.
- Fully Addressed: All issues or suggestions have been addressed.
If the code relevant to the Review Comment has been completely removed in the Subsequent Code Changes, and it is not possible to determine whether the removal was an intentional response to the comment, you can classify it as ""Not Enough Information"".

Output Format:
Analysis details:
- Addressed Items: List the issues or suggestions that have been addressed.
- Unaddressed Items: List the issues or suggestions that have not been addressed.
Classification: Based on the Addressed Items and Unaddressed Items, select one of ""Not Addressed"", ""Partly Addressed"", ""Fully Addressed"", or ""Not Enough Information"" as the final classification without more explanations.

","Analysis details:
- Addressed Items:
  • The new prefs object is passed into the AlertService constructor and used in subsequent test cases, which indirectly confirms that its inclusion does not break functionality.
  • The tests that instantiate AlertService with prefs show that the object is required for functionality and does not introduce conflicts or unexpected behavior.
  • The trailing comma is retained in the new code and is valid syntax in Kotlin, addressing the syntax concern.
- Unaddressed Items:
  • None

","Analysis details:
- Addressed Items:
  • Consistency in naming: The enum constant was renamed from NOT_COMPLETE_AUCTION to NOT_COMPLETED_AUCTION.
- Unaddressed Items:
  • Typographical error: The typo “겅매” in the message for NOT_COMPLETED_AUCTION was not fixed.
  • Semicolon placement: The semicolon was not moved to a new line.
  • Documentation: No comments or Javadoc were added for the enum constants.

https://api.github.com/repos/UnUniFi/chain/pulls/comments/1189776413,"Input Format:
Code Review:
- Reviewed Path: The file path of the code change.
- Reviewed Change: The code change under review. (""+"" indicates added lines, ""-"" indicates removed lines)
- Review Comment: A list of issues or suggestions for the above changes.
Subsequent Code Changes: A cumulative code changes made to the reviewed file after the review.

Task: For each item in the Review Comment, analyze whether it has been addressed by the Subsequent Code Changes by determining if:
- The issue has been completely resolved.
- The suggestion has been completely followed. (If the suggestion includes concrete code examples, it does not need to be followed exactly. As long as the code change serves the same intended purpose, the suggestion can be considered addressed.)
After completing the analysis, classify the entire review comment into one of the following categories:
- Not Addressed: None of the issues or suggestions have been addressed by the Subsequent Code Changes.
- Partly Addressed: Some but not all issues or suggestions have been addressed.
- Fully Addressed: All issues or suggestions have been addressed.
If the code relevant to the Review Comment has been completely removed in the Subsequent Code Changes, and it is not possible to determine whether the removal was an intentional response to the comment, you can classify it as ""Not Enough Information"".

Output Format:
Analysis details:
- Addressed Items: List the issues or suggestions that have been addressed.
- Unaddressed Items: List the issues or suggestions that have not been addressed.
Classification: Based on the Addressed Items and Unaddressed Items, select one of ""Not Addressed"", ""Partly Addressed"", ""Fully Addressed"", or ""Not Enough Information"" as the final classification without more explanations.

","Analysis details:
- Addressed Items:
  1. Consistent formatting – The refactoring to use the helper method (createBinding) ensures a uniform format across the binding definitions.
  2. Method naming consistency – The method previously named productCancelBinding has been renamed to productFlagBinding to match the queue name.
  3. Reduce redundancy – A helper method (createBinding) has been introduced to eliminate repetitive code.
- Unaddressed Items:
  4. Documentation – There are no added comments or Javadoc to explain the purpose of each binding.
