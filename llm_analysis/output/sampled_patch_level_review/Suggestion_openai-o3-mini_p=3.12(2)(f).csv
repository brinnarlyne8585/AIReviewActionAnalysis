https://api.github.com/repos/saiqulhaq/dynamic_links/pulls/comments/1440512678,2,"- suggestion to modify the initialization of nanoidstrategy by passing in the redis_config (similar to how rediscounterstrategy is instantiated). the suggested change is:
  - from: 
    shorteningstrategies::nanoidstrategy.new
  - to:
    shorteningstrategies::nanoidstrategy.new(dynamiclinks.configuration.redis_config)"
https://api.github.com/repos/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/aeon_mecha/pulls/comments/1777229984,2,- the review comment points out that the current implementation of the `class_int2str` method has a complexity of o(n²) because it iterates over the dataframe for each class. it suggests optimizing this by creating a mapping dictionary and using the pandas `replace` function to reduce the complexity. the comment provides specific code snippet details to modify the reviewed change.
https://api.github.com/repos/mrako/week-number/pulls/comments/1236833555,2,"- ""instead of checking for `date`, you can use a ternary operator inside the jsx to conditionally render the week number or a default value."""

2. lines 30–31: the review comment notes that the boolean values for `review_simple_changes` and `review_comment_lgtm` are set to `false` and advises verifying that these settings meet the intended behavior of the workflow, with an implication to change them if necessary."

https://api.github.com/repos/aidar-freeed/ai-codereviewer/pulls/comments/1149858445,2,1. the function name `dividebyseven` does not match its implementation. consider renaming it to better reflect its purpose.
https://api.github.com/repos/parkpow/deep-license-plate-recognition/pulls/comments/1929972018,2,"- ""to enhance error handling, consider logging additional details like the url or payload in the error message for better traceability."" the suggestion includes a specific diff change:
