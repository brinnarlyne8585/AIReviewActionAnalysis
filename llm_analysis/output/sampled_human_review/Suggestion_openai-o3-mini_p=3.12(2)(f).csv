https://api.github.com/repos/pokt-network/pocket/pulls/comments/1184436462,2,"1. ""maybe a `consideration: if switching to newrandomsub, there will be a max size`"" – this comment points out that when using `pubsub.newrandomsub` (as referenced in the code note) one must handle or consider the maximum size parameter. it focuses on the reviewed file, specifically referencing the change where `newrandomsub` is invoked, and suggests that additional handling may be needed."
